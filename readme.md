# Plex History to Tautulli
A Python script to convert Plex history from the API to the Tautulli database import format. Born out of spite of all the reddit posts and the FAQ saying it can't be done.

**Note:** This script now uses the modern Plex JSON API as documented at https://developer.plex.tv/pms/. It no longer requires BeautifulSoup or XML parsing. 

## Per the FAQ
> _**Q: Can Tautulli import history from before it was installed?**_
>
> _**A:** No, unless you had PlexWatch or Plexivity installed previously and import the database, Tautulli can only start logging history after it is installed._
>
> _Although Plex does keep some information in their database, it is nowhere near detailed enough to build the level of history that Tautulli keeps, the above tools keep enough information to build partial records from._

While it's true that Plex doesn't store as much detailed information as Tautulli can use, it gives enough to give you a _**general**_ idea of what was going on before you had Tautulli installed. 

### Missing Information
As long as you don't care about the following information, then you should be all set to use this:
- IP Addresses
- Product used to watch
- Pauses
- Specific stream information
	- Whether it was LAN, WAN, etc
	- Whether it was direct, copy, or transcode
	- The video and audio specific bit rates, transcode selections
- If the stream was through SSH or not

### Accessible and Accurate Information
What it will give you is:
- Date
- User
- Platform
- Player
- Basic media metadata
	- Title
	- Parent Title
	- Grandparent Title
- Start Time

### Accessible and Inaccurate Information
This script makes the assumption that media was started and watched all the way through with no pauses. This means that even if a user only watched 1 minute of a movie, it would set the stopped and duration to the full movie length.

## Setup
Requirements:
- Python3.12

Install requirements with `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Environment Variables
```env
PLEX_API_KEY=PLEX_ACCESS_TOKEN
PLEX_URL=192.168.1.1
PLEX_PORT=32400
TAUTULLI_URL=192.168.1.1
TAUTULLI_PORT=8181
TAUTULLI_API_KEY=TAUTULLI_API_KEY
```

## Running
The script can be ran with `plex_history_to_tautulli.py`. This will fetch User, Device, Library, Media, and History data from Plex, and User data from Tautulli. This information is used to build as much data as possible for the Tautulli database import.

Once the script is complete, there will be a `plex_to_tautulli.db` file in the folder. This can then be used to upload via the Tautulli Import & Backups menu.

# Known Issues/Lack of Features

## Library Support
This currently only support `movie` and `show` library types.

## Missing Media
Media that has been deleted from the Plex server or is just missing metadata will not be included. These entries are usually missing the `ratingKey` from the Plex History API call. These can be verified using the Plex API endpoint: `http://PLEX_URL:PLEX_PORT/status/sessions/history/all` with the header `X-Plex-Token: PLEX_API_KEY` and `Accept: application/json`

## SSH Support
This script appends `http://` to the environment variable `PLEX_URL` and thus only supports `HTTP` at the moment
